Jack Sprat could eat no fat.
His wife could eat no lean.
And so between them both, you see.
They licked the platter clean.

Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker’s man.
Bake me a cake as fast as you can.
Pat it and prick it and mark it with B.
Put it in the oven for baby and me.

Baa baa black sheep.
Have you any wool.
Yes sir, yes sir.
Three bags full.

One for the master.
One for the dame.
And one for the little boy
Who lives down the lane.

Hickory, dickory, dock.
The mouse ran up the clock.
The clock struck one.
The mouse ran down.
Hickory, dickory, dock.

Ladybug ladybug fly away home.
Your house in on fire and your children are gone.
All except one and that’s little Ann.
For she crept under the frying pan.


Ladybird, ladybird, fly away home.
Your house is on fire, your children all gone.
Except little Nan, who sits in a pan.
Weaving her laces as fast as she can.

Mary, Mary, quite contrary.
How does your garden grow.
With silver bells, and cockle shells.
And pretty maids all in a row.

Jack and Jill went up the hill.
To fetch a pail of water.
Jack fell down and broke his crown.
And Jill came tumbling after.

Up Jack got and home did trot.
As fast as he could caper.
And went to bed to mend his head.
With vinegar and brown paper.

This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy stayed at home.
This little piggy has roast beef.
This little piggy had none.
And this little piggy cried “Wee! Wee! Wee!” all the way home.

Simple Simon met a pieman.
Going to the fair.
Said Simple Simon to the pie man.
“Let me taste your ware.”

Said the pie-man to Simple Simon.
“Show me first your penny!”
Said Simple Simon to the pie-man.
“Indeed I have not any!”

He went to catch a dicky bird.
And thought he would not fail.
Because he had a little salt
To put upon his tail.

He went to ride a spotted cow.
That had a little calf.
She threw him down upon the ground.
Which made the people laugh.

Then Simple Simon went a-hunting.
For to catch a hare.
He rode a goat about the street.
But could not find one there.

Simple Simon went to town.
To buy a piece of meat.
He tied it to his horse’s tail.
To keep it clean and sweet.

Simple Simon went a-fishing.
For to catch a whale.
And all the water he had got.
Was in his mother’s pail.

He went to take a bird’s nest.
’Twas built upon a bough.
A branch gave way, and Simon fell.
Into a dirty slough.

He went to shoot a wild duck.
But the wild duck flew away.
Says Simon: “I can’t hit him.
Because he will not stay.”

Once Simon made a great snowball.
And brought it in to roast.
He laid it down upon the fire.
And soon the ball was lost.

He went to slide upon the ice.
Before the ice would bear.
Then he plunged in above his knees.
Which made poor Simon stare.

Simple Simon went to look.
If plums grew on a thistle.
He pricked his finger very much.
Which made poor Simon whistle.

He washed himself with blacking ball.
Because he had no soap.
And then said to his mother.
“I’m a beauty now, I hope.”

He went for water in a sieve.
But soon it all ran through.
And now poor Simple Simon.
Bids you all adieu.

Little Jack Horner.
Sat in the corner.
Eating a Christmas pie.
He put in his thumb.
And pulled out a plum.
And said “What a good boy am I!”

Hey diddle diddle.
The cat and the fiddle.
The cow jumped over the moon.
The little dog laughed to see such sport.
And the dish ran away with the spoon.

I had a little nut tree.
Nothing would it bear.
But a silver nutmeg.
And a golden pear.

The King of Spain’s daughter.
Came to visit me.
And all for the sake.
Of my little nut tree.

Her dress was made of crimson.
Jet black was her hair.
She asked me for my nut tree.
And my golden pear.

I said, “So fair a princess.
Never did I see.
IÕll give you all the fruit.
From my little nut tree.”

I danced o’er the water.
I danced o’er the sea.
And all the birds in the air.
Couldn’t catch me.

They`re all jumping on the sofa instead!

Wash hands well each day.
To keep germs away.
Scrub with soap and water,
And be on your way.

I'm a little snowman short and fat,
Here's my scarf and here's my hat.
When I see the snowfall,
Hear me shout.
- All you children please come out!

Jack be nimble,
Jack be quick,
Jack jump over.
The candlestick.

Little Boo Peep has lost her sheep.
And can`t tell where to find them.
Leave them alone.
And they'll come home.
And bringing their tails behind them.

Little Bo peep fell fast asleep.
And dreamt she heard them bleating,
When she awoke, she found it a joke.
For they were all still a fleeting.

Then up she took a little crook.
Determined for to find them.
She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed.
For they`d left their tails behind them.

It happened one day, as Boo Peep did stray.
Into a meadow hard by.
There she espied their tails side by side.
All hung on a tree to dry.

She heaved a sigh, and wiped her eye.
And over the hillocks went rambling.
And tried what she could.
As a shepherdess should.
To tack again each to its lambkin.

Mary had a little lamb,
little lamb, little lamb.
Mary had a little lamb,
it`s fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went,
Mary went, Mary went,
and everywhere that Mary went
- the lamb was sure to go.

It followed her to school one day
school one day, school one day.
It followed her to school one day,
which was against the rules.
It made the children laugh and play,
laugh and play, laugh and play,
it made the children laugh and play.
- to see a lamb in school.

And so the teacher turned it out,
turned it out, turned it out.
And so the teacher turned it out,
but still it lingered near,
And waited patiently about,
patiently about, patiently about,
And waited patiently about.
- till Mary did appear.

"Why does the lamb love Mary so?"
Love Mary so? Love Mary so?
"Why does the lamb love Mary so,"
the eager children cry.
"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know."
The lamb, you know, the lamb, you know,
"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know"
 the teacher did reply.
